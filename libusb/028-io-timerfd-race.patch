Subject: [PATCH] io.c: Avoid timerfd race condition between completion and new submit

An event handler thread working on transfer completion for the last
flying transfer with a timeout can end up racing with a call to
libusb_submit_transfer() from a second thread, so that the timerfd
gets disarmed even though libusb actually again has a transfer with
a timeout.

By arming or disarming the timerfd during completion strictly
according to remaining flying transfers while also holding the
flying_transfers_lock this change ensures that a new transfer can
not be added to the flying list until the completion code path has
armed/disarmed the timerfd according to the current flying list.

Hans de Goede describes the race condition situation in
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29520709
