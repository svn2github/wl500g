Subject: [PATCH] net: reorder fields of struct socket

On x86_64, its rather unfortunate that "wait_queue_head_t wait"
field of "struct socket" spans two cache lines (assuming a 64
bytes cache line in current cpus)

offsetof(struct socket, wait)=0x30
sizeof(wait_queue_head_t)=0x18

This might explain why Kenny Chang noticed that his multicast workload
was performing bad with 64 bit kernels, since more cache lines ping pongs
were involved.

This litle patch moves "wait" field next "fasync_list" so that both
fields share a single cache line, to speedup sock_def_readable()
