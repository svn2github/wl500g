Subject: [PATCH] NFSD: memory corruption due to writing beyond the stat array

If nfsd fails to find an exported via NFS file in the readahead cache, it
should increment corresponding nfsdstats counter (ra_depth[10]), but due to a
bug it may instead write to ra_depth[11], corrupting the following field.

In a kernel with NFSDv4 compiled in the corruption takes the form of an
increment of a counter of the number of NFSv4 operation 0's received; since
there is no operation 0, this is harmless.

In a kernel with NFSDv4 disabled it corrupts whatever happens to be in the
memory beyond nfsdstats.
