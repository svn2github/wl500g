20100418 (with release 1.1.2):
    First version with proper ChangeLog; added Digicom 8E4455 (needs multiple
    commands, implemented in usb-modeswitch-1.1.2); added all other Pirelli
    target IDs (from "option" driver) assuming they behave like the Digicom -
    this is EXPERIMENTAL; added several ZTE devices and S.E. MD300, contributed
    by Betavine project; new rule to add a symlink to interrupt ports (ignored
    if wrapper is < 1.1.2)
20100322:
    Changed all ZTE devices to the "non-eject" command after annother report
    of "eject" failure; even older ZTE devices seem to work with the former;
    a conflict was exposed between two versions of 16d8:6803 (C-motech D50);
    changed the default to the one which keeps the ID during switching
